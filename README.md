#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry
-
Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It is a systematic and disciplined approach to software development that aims to create high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software.

•	Software engineering includes a variety of techniques, tools, and methodologies, including requirements analysis, design, testing, and maintenance useful in the world of tech.

•	It is a rapidly evolving field, and new tools and technologies are constantly being developed to improve the software development process.

•	By following the principles of software engineering and using the appropriate tools and methodologies, software developers can create high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software that meets the needs of its users.

•	Software Engineering is mainly used for large projects based on software systems rather than single programs or applications.

•	The main goal of Software Engineering is to develop software applications for improving quality,  budget, and time efficiency.

•	Software Engineering ensures that the software that has to be built should be consistent, correct, also on budget, on time, and within the required requirements.



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-
I) The development of programming languages like Fortran and C represents an evolution in development in how humans communicate with machines, moving from raw binary to more structured, user-friendly tools.

II) The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s was a response to a crisis in computing—a moment when the tech world realized that building software wasn’t just a craft but needed structure, rigor, and a proper framework.

III) The advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s. Structured programming emerged in the 1970s as a response to chaotic "spaghetti code," with pioneers advocating for clear, logical control structures (sequence, selection, iteration) to make software more reliable and maintainable, shaping languages like Pascal and C. While Agile methodologies rose in the 2000s, sparked by the 2001 Agile Manifesto, to prioritize flexibility and speed over rigid plans, using iterative cycles like Scrum sprints to adapt quickly to changing demands in the fast-paced internet era.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-
Stage1: Planning and requirement analysis
Requirement Analysis is the most important and necessary stage in SDLC. The senior members of the team perform it with inputs from all the stakeholders and domain experts or SMEs in the industry.

Stage2: Defining Requirements
Once the requirement analysis is done, the next stage is to certainly represent and document the software requirements and get them accepted from the project stakeholders. This is accomplished through "SRS"- Software Requirement Specification document which contains all the product requirements to be constructed and developed during the project life cycle.

Stage3: Designing the Software
The next phase is about to bring down all the knowledge of requirements, analysis, and design of the software project. This phase is the product of the last two, like inputs from the customer and requirement gathering.

Stage4: Developing the project
In this phase of SDLC, the actual development begins, and the programming is built. The implementation of design begins concerning writing code. Developers have to follow the coding guidelines described by their management and programming tools like compilers, interpreters, debuggers, etc. are used to develop and implement the code.

Stage5: Testing
After the code is generated, it is tested against the requirements to make sure that the products are solving the needs addressed and gathered during the requirements stage.
During this stage, unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing are done.

Stage6: Deployment
Once the software is certified, and no bugs or errors are stated, then it is deployed. Then based on the assessment, the software may be released as it is or with suggested enhancement in the object segment.

Stage7: Maintenance
Once when the client starts using the developed systems, then the real issues come up and requirements to be solved from time to time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-
Waterfall follows a sequential, phase-by-phase approach (requirements, design, implementation), while, Agile uses an iterative, incremental process focused on flexibility and collaboration. Waterfall suits projects with fixed requirements, like a school management system, whereas Agile fits dynamic needs, like developing a startup’s mobile app where users change their minds all the time.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-
Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-
I) Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA). IDEs like Visual Studio Code or PyCharm are like a super kitchen—coding, debugging, and testing all in one spot, making life faster and less messy.

II) Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion). VCS like Git or GitHub are your recipe backups—tracking changes, letting you collab with mates, and saving you if you mess up, so the team doesn’t cook the same dish twice by mistake!

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-
CHALLENGES

I) Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.

II) Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.

III) Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

IV) Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Strategies to Overcome:

I) Effective Communication: Talk clearly with the team and clients to stay aligned.

II) Agile Methodologies: Use sprints to adapt fast and keep things flexible.

III) Prioritization of Tasks: Focus on what’s urgent and doable first.

IV) Regular Reassessment: Check goals and timelines often to keep on track.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-
I) Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software. Checking small bits of code (like functions) to make sure each one works right on its own.

II) Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems. Testing how those bits connect and talk to each other, catching issues in the handshakes.

III) System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole. Testing the whole software together to see if it runs smoothly as one.

IV) Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs. Testing with the user’s needs in mind to confirm it’s what they ordered.

Importance of Quality Control/assurance: Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.

I) Early Defect Detection: Spots problems fast, like finding a bad ingredient before cooking.

II) Higher Quality: Fixes bugs early with code reviews and automated tests, making solid software.

III) Smoother Development: Continuous integration keeps everything in sync, avoiding last-minute chaos.

IV) Happy Users: Ensures the final product matches what users want, no disappointments.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and crafting precise inputs—such as questions, commands, or statements—to guide AI language models toward producing the most relevant, accurate, and useful responses. It is giving the AI a clear set of instructions, like a GPS route, rather than a vague wave in the general direction. For example, instead of asking, "Tell me about dogs," a prompt like "List three unique traits of german shepherds" directs the AI to deliver a more focused and specific output.

Importance in Interacting with AI Models

Prompt engineering plays a critical role in maximizing the effectiveness of interactions with AI models:

I) Precision: A well-crafted prompt eliminates ambiguity, ensuring the AI delivers exactly what you’re looking for. Vague inputs lead to vague outputs, but a sharp prompt—like "Explain quantum entanglement in simple terms" versus "Tell me about physics"—cuts through the noise.

II) Efficiency: Good prompts save time. By clearly stating what you need upfront, you reduce the need for follow-up questions or clarifications. It’s the difference between getting a concise summary in one go and wading through multiple rounds of back-and-forth.

III) Context Control: AI models rely heavily on context to generate meaningful responses. A strong prompt sets the stage—whether you want a technical explanation, a casual chat, or a creative twist—helping the AI align its output with your intent. For instance, "Write a formal email to a client about a project delay" provides more contextual guidance than "Write something about a delay."

IV) Unlocking Creativity: Clever prompts can push AI to think beyond the obvious, sparking innovative or imaginative responses. Compare "Give me a business idea" to "Suggest a wild, futuristic startup concept involving AI and space travel"—the latter opens the door to more creative potential.

In essence, prompt engineering transforms AI from a blunt tool into a precision instrument. It’s not just about asking questions; it’s about asking the right questions to turn a conversation with a machine into a productive, tailored dialogue. Whether you’re seeking facts, insights, or creative sparks, the quality of your prompt determines the quality of the AI’s response.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
-
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about M-Pesa."

Improved Prompt: "Explain how M-Pesa has impacted Kenya’s economy over the past 10 years in a concise way."

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective: The vague prompt, "Tell me about M-Pesa," is too open-ended. It doesn’t specify what aspect of M-Pesa to focus on—history, technology, user base, or something else—so the response could be a mix of details, leaving you with more than you need or not enough of what you want. The improved prompt, on the other hand, is clear and targeted. It narrows the scope to M-Pesa’s economic impact, sets a specific time frame (the past 10 years), and requests a concise answer. This clarity ensures the response stays relevant, focused, and efficient, saving time and delivering exactly what’s needed.
