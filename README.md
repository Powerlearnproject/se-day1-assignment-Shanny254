#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It is a systematic and disciplined approach to software development that aims to create high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software.

•	Software engineering includes a variety of techniques, tools, and methodologies, including requirements analysis, design, testing, and maintenance useful in the world of tech.

•	It is a rapidly evolving field, and new tools and technologies are constantly being developed to improve the software development process.

•	By following the principles of software engineering and using the appropriate tools and methodologies, software developers can create high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software that meets the needs of its users.

•	Software Engineering is mainly used for large projects based on software systems rather than single programs or applications.

•	The main goal of Software Engineering is to develop software applications for improving quality,  budget, and time efficiency.

•	Software Engineering ensures that the software that has to be built should be consistent, correct, also on budget, on time, and within the required requirements.



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Stage1: Planning and requirement analysis
Requirement Analysis is the most important and necessary stage in SDLC. The senior members of the team perform it with inputs from all the stakeholders and domain experts or SMEs in the industry.

Stage2: Defining Requirements
Once the requirement analysis is done, the next stage is to certainly represent and document the software requirements and get them accepted from the project stakeholders. This is accomplished through "SRS"- Software Requirement Specification document which contains all the product requirements to be constructed and developed during the project life cycle.

Stage3: Designing the Software
The next phase is about to bring down all the knowledge of requirements, analysis, and design of the software project. This phase is the product of the last two, like inputs from the customer and requirement gathering.

Stage4: Developing the project
In this phase of SDLC, the actual development begins, and the programming is built. The implementation of design begins concerning writing code. Developers have to follow the coding guidelines described by their management and programming tools like compilers, interpreters, debuggers, etc. are used to develop and implement the code.

Stage5: Testing
After the code is generated, it is tested against the requirements to make sure that the products are solving the needs addressed and gathered during the requirements stage.
During this stage, unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing are done.

Stage6: Deployment
Once the software is certified, and no bugs or errors are stated, then it is deployed. Then based on the assessment, the software may be released as it is or with suggested enhancement in the object segment.

Stage7: Maintenance
Once when the client starts using the developed systems, then the real issues come up and requirements to be solved from time to time.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
